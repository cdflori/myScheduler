## Overview 

Welcome to your daily schedule planner! For each day the user will be able to enter a reminder on a set hour from 9 AM to 5 PM. The user will then be able to save their reminder. If the reminder is past the current time, it will be shown in gray, for current hour reminders -- shown in red, and future reminders -- shown in green.
